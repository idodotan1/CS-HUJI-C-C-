# CS-HUJI-C-C++
These are the projects I completed while taking the C & C++ course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during Semester B of 2024.
A few notes about my projects:
I received a perfect score on all my projects except for the following:
Project 1 – 90/100 (forgot to close the file).
Project 5 – 86/100 (a bonus project—I worked on it during the exam period and didn’t have enough time to complete it properly).
